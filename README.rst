The Beak Squad Programming Manual
=======================================

https://beakdocs.readthedocs.io

Informally known as "Carson Professor"

Programming order:

| Zero-to-PID:

| motors vbus (Free speed)

| servos + solenoids

| controllers

| motors w/ encoders (position / # of rotations)

| Control - limit switches, encoder limits, current sensing

| subsystems

| commands

| Dashboard

| Cameras

| (Logging)

| PID

Advanced Controls Concepts:

| Enum-based State Machines

| BeakLib

| Vision (limelight, etc)

| Drivetrains

| absolute encoders

| Object Sensing - Time of Flight, Color Sensor

| configurable subsystem commands/methods

| Sysid characterization

| Custom Dashboard Widgets?

| Auton?
