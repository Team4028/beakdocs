The Beak Squad Programming Manual
=======================================

https://beakdocs.readthedocs.io

Informally known as "Carson Professor"


Programming order:
| Zero-to-PID:
| servos + solenoids
| motors vbus (Free speed)
| motors w/ encoders (position / # of rotations)
| Control - limit switches, encoder limits, current sensing
| gamepad controller
| subsystems
| commands
| Dashboard
| Cameras
| (Logging)
| PID

Advanced Controls Concepts:
| Enum-based State Machines
| Vision (limelight, etc)
| Object Sensing - Time of Flight, Color Sensor
| At some point introduce BeakLib
| Drivetrains
| absolute encoders
| configurable subsystem commands/methods
| Sysid characterization
| Custom Dashboard Widgets?
| Auton?
